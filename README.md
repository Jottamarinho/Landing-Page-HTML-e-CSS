<h1>Landing Page in HTML and CSS</h1>
<p>
Hello, I'm Jotta, and I'm responsible for the development of the landing page. The main objective of creating a landing page is to apply my knowledge in the area of HTML and CSS language.



<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>he page is created entirely in HTML and CSS, with the main theme of telling the story and theory of great physicists who passed through our world, with the aim of    ringing knowledge to those who access the page.

<h1>Update data 1.0.0</h1>

<p>
In the search for a modern website style, based on my fundamentals I managed to leave the edges with a slight circle at the ends. Avoiding square ends on your borders with maximum change in css.

The learn more button has been added to be used in the next update as the page scroller bringing up new information. In the button was added an animation that when passing the stroke over it, it goes up in the Y axis.

I am a beginner in the area of programming and the only solution to link these landing page pages, at least the only one I thought of at the moment was to create several html pages with the name of each landing page. When you click on the navbar you will be directed to another tab of the landing page.
